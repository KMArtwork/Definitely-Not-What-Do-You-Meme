# Definitely Not What Do You Meme

Do you have tons of funny pictures or super niche memes that you never get a chance to share with your friends? Well do I have a game for you!

## Problem Domain

A mobile-friendly spin on the game "What do you meme?". Users a provided a caption and they must find an image from their camera roll that best fits the caption. Once the user presses `send`, a new caption is generated and a new round starts. 

Ideally, this game would be played with friends and everyone would vote on which image is the best / funniest but as of right now it's just a proof of concept so there is no voting.

## User Stories

- The user should be able to browse their phone's local files &/o their files from the cloud to choose an image

- The user should see a new caption / prompt upon sending the image
